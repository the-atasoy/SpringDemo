# Spring Boot Demo RESTful API

A demo RESTful API that consist of two entities named Employee and Department. I learned how to connect database, how to create entities and relations between entities, how to do basic CRUD operations in Spring Boot framework and what Spring Boot framework uses for.

### Technolgies I Used

* Spring Boot Framework
* Data JPA
* Postgre SQL Database
* Swagger Extension

### Note

<font color="red">You do not need to create tables in the database if you have the database and the schema indicated in the `application.properties` file because of the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` line. This line provides you auto-update and create in the database when entities have changes.</font>
